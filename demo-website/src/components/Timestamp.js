    We met with the TTC Manager of New Technology & Innovation, Naina Dewan, on March 13, 2025.

    She was kindly on board with supporting our group as our sponsor, providing informal feedback on our project as we work on it for the rest of the semester.

    Check out our presentation, complete with drawn mockups of our design:

      The construction team is hard at work creating a cardboard model of a TTC car.

      We will be using this to simulate a TTC train environment for our image recognition model.
