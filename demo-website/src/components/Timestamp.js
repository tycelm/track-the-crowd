  Imagine life without me, it's a waste of time
  You want the kind of love that can make a child
  Don't want just anybody (not just anybody, not just anybody)
  Ooh
  Good love fills my body up like a glass
  When you pour it all out


  If you know me, you know I mind
  Someone like me is hard to find
  Not mistaken if I'm there
  Well aware you are always mine
  And still you seem so surprised
  Always gon' be mine
  I wanna be where you are
  I just can't walk away
  You drive me crazy, ah
  I lose it, lose it
  And I wanna be where you are
  I just can't walk away
  You drive me crazy, ah
  I lose it, lose it
  Imagine me
  Circlin' through life without a piece of you
  Seven out of seven days I'm needin' you
  You brin' life to the party
  Good love feels like butterflies suffocatin' your insides
  Oh, it's a late night, you know I try
  I cannot picture when you ride
  I'm mistaken thinkin' you were taken
  Knownin' now, you were always mine
  And still I feel so surprised
  You're always gon' be mine
  In my eyes
Indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face
Lies the snake
And the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat
Summer stench
Neath the black, the sky looks dead
Call my name
Through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Won't you come
Stuttering
Cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone
For honest men
Sometimes, far too long for snakes
In my shoes
Walking sleep
In my youth, I pray to keep
Heaven send
Hell away
No one sings like you anymore
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Hang my head
Drown my fear
Till you all just disappear
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come
Won't you come`,
