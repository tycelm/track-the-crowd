    This morning, we met with the TTC Manager of New Technology & Innovation, Naina Dewan.

    She was kindly on board with supporting our group as our sponsor, providing informal feedback on our project as we work on it for the rest of the semester.

    Check out our presentation, complete with drawn mockups of our design:

      We've split off into two teams: the backend team, responsible for creating the image recognition model, and the frontend team, responsible for creating this website and the methods of communicating crowd data to customers.
      
      We've also been hard at work creating a cardboard model of a TTC car. We will be using this to simulate a TTC train environment for our image recognition model.

      Joshua is holding two metal poles, what could they be for? Stay tuned to find out!
