Imagine life without me, it's a waste of time
You want the kind of love that can make a child
Don't want just anybody (not just anybody, not just anybody)
Ooh
Good love fills my body up like a glass
When you pour it all out
If you know me, you know I mind
Someone like me is hard to find
Not mistaken if I'm there
Well aware you are always mine
And still you seem so surprised
Always gon' be mine
I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away
You drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it
And I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away
You drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it
Imagine me
Circlin' through life without a piece of you
Seven out of seven days I'm needin' you
You brin' life to the party
Good love feels like butterflies suffocatin' your insides
Oh, it's a late night, you know I try
I cannot picture when you ride
I'm mistaken thinkin' you were taken
Knownin' now, you were always mine
And still I feel so surprised
You're always gon' be mine`,
